            <h2>Resume Analysis for: AI ML engieer</h2>

            <h3>Resume vs Job Description Categories</h3>
            <pre>Okay, I'm ready to analyze the resume you provided using the provided Python code and job description placeholder. I will focus on providing actionable feedback.

Here's how I'll approach the task:

1.  **Execute the Code:** I will run the Python code you provided. This code leverages the `google.generativeai` library (Gemini model) to analyze the resume against a (currently empty) job description.
2.  **Analyze the Output:** The code generates an HTML report, which I will then carefully examine.  I will pay close attention to these sections:
    *   **Categories:** How well the model parsed the resume into sections (Education, Skills, Projects, etc.).
    *   **Match Score:** The overall percentage match.
    *   **Matching & Missing Skills:**  This is CRUCIAL. It will highlight the keywords the model identified as present or absent.
    *   **Recommendations:**  The model's suggestions for improvement.
    *   **ATS Optimization Score:** This is important for understanding how well the resume might pass through automated systems.
3.  **Provide Expert Feedback:** Based on the report, I will provide *specific, actionable* advice, going beyond the model's suggestions. I will focus on:
    *   **Content Alignment:** How to tailor the resume content to better align with the *implied* requirements of a typical AI/ML Engineer role, given the absence of a specific job description.
    *   **Skills Emphasis:**  How to highlight the most relevant AI/ML skills and downplay less relevant ones.
    *   **Project Presentation:** How to present projects to demonstrate impact and quantify results.
    *   **ATS Optimization:** How to improve the resume's structure and formatting for better ATS compatibility.
    *   **Overall Impression:**  The resume's strengths and weaknesses in making a compelling case for the candidate.
4. **Caveats:**

*   **No Specific Job Description:** Because you didn't provide a concrete job description, I will assume a general AI/ML Engineer profile.  The accuracy of the analysis will be limited by this. Provide a job description for a more precise analysis.
*   **Gemini's Performance:** The quality of the analysis depends on the capabilities of the Gemini model.  It might make errors in parsing or matching. I will try to correct for these errors in my feedback.
*   **"Final Year Undergraduate" Context:** I will keep in mind that the candidate is a final year student, so expectations for experience will be lower.

**Let's begin!**

I need you to execute the code first and share the content of the `resume_analysis_report.html` file.  Then, I will provide my expert analysis.
</pre>

            <h3>Match Score</h3>
            <p>Okay, I'm ready to analyze the resume. Please provide the `job_description` variable so I can execute the code and provide a detailed analysis. I need the job description to effectively use the `analyze_resume` function.  Once you provide the `job_description`, I will:

1.  **Run the `analyze_resume` function** with the given resume text and job description.
2.  **Present the output:** I'll present the generated HTML report in a readable format, highlighting key sections like the categorized resume and job description elements, match score, skill matching analysis, recommendations, and ATS score.
3.  **Provide High-Level Summary & Actionable Advice:**  Beyond the report, I will offer a concise summary of the resume's strengths and weaknesses, as well as targeted advice beyond what the script provides to make it even *stronger* for AI/ML Engineer roles.  This will incorporate my expert knowledge.

**Example:**

Let's say you provide the following `job_description`:

```
We are looking for a skilled AI/ML Engineer to develop and deploy machine learning models.

Responsibilities:
*   Design, develop, and deploy machine learning models.
*   Work with large datasets to train and evaluate models.
*   Implement machine learning algorithms and libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate models into production systems.
*   Monitor model performance and retrain as needed.
*   Stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in AI/ML.

Qualifications:

*   Proficiency in Python.
*   Experience with data preprocessing and feature engineering.
*   Strong problem-solving skills.
*   Excellent communication and teamwork skills.
```

Then, I will run the code with this job description and the given resume.  Provide the `job_description` so I can proceed.
</p>

            <h3>Matching & Missing Skills</h3>
            <pre>Okay, I'm ready to analyze the resume based on the provided code and instructions. To do this effectively, I need the actual job description.  Please provide the job description for the "AI ML Engineer" position so I can run the analysis.

Once you provide the job description, I will:

1.  **Run the Analysis:** I'll execute the `analyze_resume` function with the resume text you've already provided and the job description you'll provide. This will leverage the `gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation` model (you'll need to ensure you have set up the `google.generativeai` library correctly and have an API key if required).
2.  **Interpret the Output:** I'll receive the HTML report generated by the function.
3.  **Provide a Comprehensive Summary:** I will then summarize the key findings from the report, including:

    *   **Categorized Resume & Job Description Content:**  I'll present the extracted information about education, skills, projects, etc., for both the resume and the job description.
    *   **Match Score:** I'll report the overall percentage match between the resume and the job description.
    *   **Matching & Missing Skills:**  I'll detail the specific technical skills that align with the job description and the critical skills that are missing.
